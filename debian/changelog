  * Switch from cdbs to the dh sequencer:
    - drop build dependency on cdbs

    - run the lntest executable in a non-fatal way, as it fails and it is
      not run as a test by the build system

    - bump debhelper build dependency to 9
    - bump compat to 9 (this also makes use of dpkg-buildflags)

    - mark libnova-0.14-0 as Multi-Arch: same
    - make libnova-0.14-0 pre-depend on ${misc:Pre-Depends}

  * Explicitly remove .la files from debian/tmp, instead of ignore them
    in dh_install.
